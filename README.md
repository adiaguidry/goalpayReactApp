# Goals Pay Off
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Overview
This is an on going project that I am currently pouring myself into. I have plans of bringing Node with Express and MongoDB into play. This project was inspired by my ten year old son. The child user sets goals for themselves.

This project is also intended to teach children the value of a dollar. As goals are established by the child, the view in the Admin interface was also updated. 


As they completes the goal, they hit a button and the parent is notified. The parent decides how much the child is paid for a job well done. I pay him through virtual money. That money is allocated to accounts through Reacts Drag and Drop package.

Currently live on Heroku: [Dashboard-live](https://adiaguidry.github.io/deploy-goalspay-github-pages/#/admin)
